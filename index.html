    <h1>Why Batman x Superman is the Only Correct Pairing</h1>
    <p>Batman and Superman stand on opposite ends of power and method, yet each sees in the other a reflection of the same belief: that humanity is worth protecting. Superman admires Batman’s unshakable faith in human will, how a man without powers chooses every day to fight for justice through discipline, sacrifice, and compassion hidden beneath the cowl. Batman, in turn, respects Superman not for his strength, but for his restraint—his choice to remain gentle, hopeful, and deeply human despite godlike ability.</p>
